                        Correctly inserted, a menstrual cup is so comfortable that you wont even know it's there. It may take a little practice at first as you need to find the angle and position that is right for you. Once you have perfected it you will be amazed at how simple a menstrual cup is to use. You will need to empty, rinse or wipe and reinsert your menstrual cup every four to eight hours depending on your flow. The fluid remains inside the cup, and the process is not messy or uncomfortable. A menstrual cup can safely be used overnight and is great for all sports, swimming and travelling. It can be cleaned in the same way as baby equipment: with sterilising fluid, or by boiling for five minutes in an open pan of water. “I only just started using a cup about 6 months ago and I swear, I'll tell anyone who asks about it that I wish I knew about menstrual cups 20 years ago. It has saved me so much money and is soooo easy to use and maintain! Some of my friends think it's gross, but I just think it's because they haven't done the research that's needed. I will definitely be buying one for my daughter when the time comes!“
