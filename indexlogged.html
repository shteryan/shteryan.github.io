                        <h2>What Is A Menstrual Cup?</h2>
                    </header>
                    <p>
                        If you've never heard of a menstrual cup before, it can seem pretty strange, alternative or weird (imagine the reactions when they first came up with tampons!). Yet, a menstrual cup has so many benefits, which has resulted in many women switching from tampons and pads. A menstrual cup is a hygienic, reusable sanitary product, made from a soft, medical grade silicon. They are around two inches long and are usually irritant free. Most brands contain no latex, dyes, BPA, toxins or bleaches. A menstrual cup is worn internally like a tampon, but it collects menstrual fluid rather than absorbing it. You simply empty the fluid into the toilet – and even better – they don't need to be changed as frequently as tampons or pads. Unlike tampons, a menstrual cup is not a disposable product, so you only need to buy one, saving you a tonne of money.

                        Most menstrual cups hold around 30 ml of menstrual fluid, which is around one third of the average total flow each period. When you insert a menstrual cup, a light seal is formed with your vaginal wall, allowing the menstrual flow to pass into the cup, without any leakage or odour. It's likely that you'll empty a menstrual cup less frequently than you'd replace tampons or pads. “I've been using one for about 15 years. No more painful cramps that I used to get with tampons. They're amazing.“

                        Correctly inserted, a menstrual cup is so comfortable that you wont even know it's there. It may take a little practice at first as you need to find the angle and position that is right for you. Once you have perfected it you will be amazed at how simple a menstrual cup is to use. You will need to empty, rinse or wipe and reinsert your menstrual cup every four to eight hours depending on your flow. The fluid remains inside the cup, and the process is not messy or uncomfortable. A menstrual cup can safely be used overnight and is great for all sports, swimming and travelling. It can be cleaned in the same way as baby equipment: with sterilising fluid, or by boiling for five minutes in an open pan of water. “I only just started using a cup about 6 months ago and I swear, I'll tell anyone who asks about it that I wish I knew about menstrual cups 20 years ago. It has saved me so much money and is soooo easy to use and maintain! Some of my friends think it's gross, but I just think it's because they haven't done the research that's needed. I will definitely be buying one for my daughter when the time comes!“
